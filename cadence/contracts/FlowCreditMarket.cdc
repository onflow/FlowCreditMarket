    /* --- NUMERIC TYPES POLICY ---
        - External/public APIs (Vault amounts, deposits/withdrawals, events) use UFix64.
        - Internal accounting and risk math use UFix128: scaled/true balances, interest indices/rates,
          health factor, and prices once converted.
        Rationale:
        - Interest indices and rates are modeled as 18-decimal fixed-point in FlowCreditMarketMath and stored as UFix128.
        - Operating in the UFix128 domain minimizes rounding error in true↔scaled conversions and
          health/price computations.
        - We convert at boundaries via type casting to UFix128 or FlowCreditMarketMath.toUFix64.
