## 🏦 About FlowCreditMarket

FlowCreditMarket is a decentralized lending and borrowing protocol built on the Flow blockchain. It implements the Flow FungibleToken standard and integrates with DeFi Actions for composability.

### Key Features

- **FungibleToken Standard**: Full compatibility with Flow wallets and DEXs
- **DeFi Actions Integration**: Composable with other DeFi protocols via Sink/Source interfaces
- **Vault Operations**: Secure deposit and withdraw functionality
- **Position Management**: Create and manage lending/borrowing positions
- **Interest Mechanics**: Compound interest calculations with configurable rates
- **Health Monitoring**: Real-time position health calculations and overdraft protection
- **Access Control**: Secure entitlement-based access with proper authorization
- **Token Agnostic**: Supports any FungibleToken.Vault implementation (FlowVault removed)

### Technical Highlights

- Implements `FungibleToken.Vault` interface for standard token operations
- Provides `DeFiActions.Sink` and `DeFiActions.Source` for DeFi composability
- Uses scaled balance tracking for efficient interest accrual
- Supports multiple positions per pool with independent tracking
- Includes comprehensive metadata views for wallet integration

## 🧪 Test Suite

The project includes comprehensive tests covering all functionality:

```bash
# Run all tests with coverage
flow test --cover

# Run specific test file
flow test cadence/tests/core_vault_test.cdc
```

### Test Results Summary
- **Core Vault Operations**: ✅ 3/3 passing
- **Interest Mechanics**: ✅ 6/6 passing
- **Position Health**: ✅ 3/3 passing
- **Token State Management**: ✅ 3/3 passing
- **Reserve Management**: ✅ 3/3 passing
- **Access Control**: ✅ 2/2 passing
- **Edge Cases**: ✅ 3/3 passing
- **Simple Import**: ✅ 2/2 passing

**Total**: 22/22 tests passing with 89.7% code coverage

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [Flow CLI](https://developers.flow.com/tools/flow-cli/install) installed
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with [Cadence extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=onflow.cadence)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/onflow/FlowCreditMarket.git
cd FlowCreditMarket
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
flow deps install
cd FlowActions && flow deps install && cd ..
```

3. Run tests:
```bash
flow test --cover
```

### Deploy to Emulator

## 🔧 Contract Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Pool**: Main lending pool managing positions and reserves
2. **Position**: User positions tracking deposits and borrows
3. **TokenState**: Per-token state including interest indices
4. **FlowCreditMarketSink/Source**: DeFi Actions integration for composability

### Key Interfaces

- `FungibleToken.Vault`: Standard token operations
- `ViewResolver`: Metadata views for wallets
- `Burner.Burnable`: Token burning capability
- `DeFiActions.Sink/Source`: DeFi protocol composability

## 🛠️ Development

### Creating a Position

```cadence
// Create a new pool with your token type
let pool <- FlowCreditMarket.createPool(
    defaultToken: Type<@YourToken.Vault>(),
    defaultTokenThreshold: 0.8
)

// Create a position
let positionId = pool.createPosition()

// Deposit funds
let vault <- YourToken.mintTokens(amount: 100.0)
pool.deposit(pid: positionId, funds: <-vault)
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
flow test --cover

# Run FlowCreditMarket tests
flow test --cover --covercode="contracts" --coverprofile="coverage.lcov" ./cadence/tests/*_test.cdc

# Run specific test category
flow test cadence/tests/interest_mechanics_test.cdc
```
